# Pizza-Sales-Intelligence
A comprehensive Pizza Sales Report project analyzing key performance metrics using interactive dashboards. Includes insights on best and worst selling pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders, sales performance by category and size, and identification of peak sales periods across days and months using BI visualizations.

<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em;">Project Overview</h2>
This project is an end-to-end data analysis portfolio piece focused on a pizza sales dataset. The primary goal was to leverage SQL for data extraction and calculation of key business metrics (KPIs) and Power BI/Excel for creating interactive dashboards to visualize key sales trends and performance indicators.

<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em;">Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The business objective was to visualize various aspects of the pizza sales data to gain insights and understand key trends. Specifically, we needed to analyze business performance through key indicators and visualize order patterns, customer preferences, and sales distribution.</p>


<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em;">Technology Stack</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Database & ETL:</strong> SQL (used for querying, calculating KPIs, and aggregating data for visualizations).</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> Power BI / Excel (used for data modeling, DAX/formulas, and dashboard design).</li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em;">Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Required</h2>
<p>We calculated the following essential business metrics:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Total Revenue:</strong> The sum of the total price of all pizza orders.</li>
  <li><strong>Average Order Value:</strong> The average amount spent per order (Total Revenue / Total Orders).</li>
  <li><strong>Total Pizzas Sold:</strong> The sum of the quantities of all pizzas sold.</li>
  <li><strong>Total Orders:</strong> The total number of orders placed.</li>
  <li><strong>Average Pizzas Per Order:</strong> The average number of pizzas sold per order (Total Pizzas Sold / Total Orders).</li>
</ol>


<h2 style="font-size: 1.2em;">Chart Requirements & Analysis</h2>
<p>The dashboard was structured to meet the following visualization requirements:</p>
